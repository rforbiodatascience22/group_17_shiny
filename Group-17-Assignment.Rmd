## Discussions  
# What did you find most challenging about creating a shiny app?  


# What do you feel are the benefits and challenges with using golem for app development?  


# Maintaining reproducibility when using shiny apps is a challenge. As an example, some pharma-companies display databases to medical doctors for pointy-clicky data exploration. What are your thoughts on maintaining reproducibility in that scenario? What if the database is updated or the app is updated with new or changed functionality?  


# What other challenges and limitations do you see shiny apps may have? Please elaborate.
